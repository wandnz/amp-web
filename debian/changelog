amp-web (1.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added ability for users to rate displayed events (requires ampy 2.4).
  * Fixed some bugs where an updating dashboard would remove event groups that
    had been previously displayed.
  * Improved the process of selecting which event groups to display on the
    dashboard. Event groups that have the same ASNs or the same events are
    combined.
  * Fix bug where events from previous days would retain the 'Today' label in
    their date string.
  * Fixed bug where a self-updating dashboard would occasionally put event
    groups in the wrong order.
  * Fix crash when generating a label for a DNS loss event.
  * Added workaround for bogus AS name data so the affected AS is at least
    somewhat identifiable, rather than being a random letter.
  * Fix bug where the filter displayed on the dashboard would get out of sync
    with the filter being applied to fetched events, causing the wrong filter
    to be applied.
  * Added a somewhat useful summary graph to the Traceroute Path Map. This
    fixes the problem where the selection handles were often not visible
    because we never drew a summary graph (requires ampy 2.4)
